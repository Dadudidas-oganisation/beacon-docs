**Authors:** Andreas Gassmann

**Status:** Complete, action items in progress

**Summary:** A security vulnerability was discovered in the beacon-sdk that would allow attackers in some circumstances to inject arbitrary Javascript into dApps.

**Impact:** If a dApp was opened in an iFrame on a malicious website, through a hyperlink from a malicious website, or if a malicious browser extension was installed, the attacker would have been able to inject arbitrary Javascript that would be executed in the dApp context. The vulnerability only affected dApps, it did not affect wallets or the Beacon network.

**Root Causes:** The beacon-sdk used `innerHTML` to display user provided data. The source of the user provided data was not checked, nor was the data sanitised before it was displayed. This made injection of Javascript into the website possible vis DOM based XSS (Cross Site Scripting).

**Resolution:** Two separate mitigations were implemented:

1. The origin of the data the SDK receives through the `postMessage` interface is now checked and messages from unsafe origins are ignored.
2. The UI no longer uses `innerHTML` to display data. Instead, only text is displayed, making it impossible to inject malicious Javascript.

**Detection:** The vulnerability was found by Maciej Domanski, Security Engineer at Trail of Bits, during a security review of another project. After discovering that the beacon-sdk was the cause of the issue, the Trail of Bits team privately reached out to us to disclose the vulnerabilty.

**Action Items:**

| Action Item                                        | Type     | Owner   | State       |
| -------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| Update beacon-sdk to fix vulnerability             | mitigate | andreas | COMPLETE    |
| Monitor dApp ecosystem and reach out to developers | mitigate | andreas | IN PROGRESS |

## Conclusion

- The vulnerability was found, fixed and most dApps updated in a little over a week. A huge thanks to the community for reacting quickly.
- As far as we are aware, the vulnerability has not been actively exploited.
- The security vulnerability only affected dApps. Wallets and the Beacon Network were not affected.
