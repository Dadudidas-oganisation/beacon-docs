This is a list of all the dApps that are using beacon and their version. If a dApp is missing, please let us know.

dApps should always use the latest `beacon-sdk` version for the latest features and fixes.

```ts noInline
import { SDK_VERSION } from "@airgap/beacon-sdk";
import DAppTable from "@site/src/components/DAppTable";

render(
  <>
    <p>
      The most recent version of the beacon-sdk is <b>{SDK_VERSION}</b>.
    </p>
    <DAppTable />
  </>
)
```
